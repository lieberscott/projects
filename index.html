    Task Force Hearings and Final Report

    <p>The Massachusetts Committee on Higher Education, for which I was the Chief of Staff, formed a 15-member Task Force to study the issue of students with disabilities. The Task Force would hold four public hearings across the state, at which members of the public could weigh in. The Task Force would also issue a report on its findings. I was responsible for forming the Task Force -- i.e., identifying and getting people to join and preparing matrials. I was also responsible for 1) booking each location, 2) ensuring each event was publicized and well-attended, and 3) ensuring that the final report was completed.</p><p>I enlisted the help of two deputies to publicize the events and act as a point of contact with each Task Force member. I also worked with two Task Force members to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/285907576/Task-Force-Report#from_embed">write the final report</a>. Once it was finished, I also organized the <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2014/04/28/tom-sannicandro-intellectual-disabilities">media</a> <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/west/2014/04/26/task-force-wants-students-with-intellectual-disabilities-have-more-access-college-courses/VVyPWVOKmDCdakEhKMoldL/story.html">coverage</a>.</p>

    Passing The Real Lives Bill

    <p>As Chief of Staff for State Rep. Tom Sannicandro, my primary responsibility was passing a piece of legislation called <a href="http://ddslearning.com/real-lives-bill/">The Real Lives bill</a>.</p><p>The Rep. had wanted the bill passed for many years before I started as his Chief of Staff. I became the principle negotiator for him. I worked with Senators and Representatives, as well as 13 partner organizations.</p><p>I needed to balance the interests of all parties, research issues that came up, write drafts that would accomodate each party's interests, and ensure the bill moved through the legislative process. After 10 months, the bill passed and became law.</p>

    Recommendations for Welfare Reform
  </div>
  <div class="blurb">
    <br/>
    <p>Our office was asked by the Speaker of the House to make formal recommendations to a welfare reform bill that the legislature would be considering. I offered each of our three staff members the chance to submit a recommendation to me, which our office would then pass on to the Speaker. My role was to ensure their recommendations fit Rep. Sannicandro's goals.</p><p>I also researched and wrote a <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/H1066">new piece of legislation</a> on the issue. The legislation established a work-study program specifically for people on welfare, so these individuals could get degrees and would be qualified employees for competitive industries. It got the support of the Massachusetts Community College Executive Office and labor and industry groups.</p>
